## How we satisfied the software requirements

We are using the Love2D framework and its corresponding Lua from Professor Adam's lecture notes. This platform meets the requirement that it "does not inherently provide support for 3D rendering and physics simulation." The third-party 3D rendering library is from Luke100000, and the third-party physics simulation library is from HDictus. We simply need to put them in the lib file and reference them in main using local = require(""). The simple physics-based puzzle involves manipulating one block to push another block to a designated (green) area. The player must manipulate the block, otherwise, they will fail after a certain time. Success or failure is indicated by text in the top left corner. Currently, we have tried using before-commit automation to check code uploads, but it is not yet complete. Post-push automation is complete; we use LÖVE Actions designed by Particle_G to automatically package the code into a .love file via GitHub Actions for download.

## Reflection

When we planned to use Love2D, we discovered after importing the library that its game files couldn't be deployed on the webpage, which caused some panic and temporarily halted the project, but we later fixed it. We then assigned the work to three people: Jeffery and Wade were responsible for writing the code, and Keith was responsible for game testing, identifying problems, and recording videos. However, we encountered problems implementing requirements 7 and 8, so we made adjustments, involving Keith in the development of the post-push automation process. The post-push automation process, worked by two people (Wade and Keith, with the help of Professor Adam), was completed in about a few hours. Jeffery also quickly automated the pre-commit process alone, and although there are still some issues, it should be completed soon. We all felt that it was important to react quickly to problematic parts next time. Effective communication within the team helped us weather this crisis. Asking professors and TAs shouldn't be a last resort, but rather something to do immediately after trying something.
