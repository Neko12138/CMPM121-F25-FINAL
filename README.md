Tools Lead: Jeffery

As the Tools Lead for our team, my primary responsibility is setting up the entire project's development environment, ensuring everyone's machines can run the game smoothly. I research and select the toolchains we'll be using, set code formatting rules and version control processes, and establish a consistent project structure to facilitate smoother team collaboration. I'll also be responsible for configuring any necessary automation processes.

Additionally, since the entire team is also serving as Engine Leads, I participate in discussions about engine selection, architecture planning, and experimenting with small examples to help everyone familiarize themselves with how the engine works. In short, my goal is to make the project more stable and efficient at the tools level, and to work with my teammates to make the best choice regarding the engine. In conclusion, this is our current allocation plan, which may be subject to change.
