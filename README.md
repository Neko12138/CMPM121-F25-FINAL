Tools Lead: Jeffery 
Engine Lead: All of us
Design Lead: Wade
Testing Lead: Keith


## Tools and materials
1&2: We currently plan to use the LÖVE framework for game development, meaning we will be programming in Lua. Lua's corresponding data languages ​​are Lua tables and JSON. We chose this framework primarily because it meets our requirements. Secondly, Lua is a lightweight language that is still powerful enough. Therefore, we believe Love2D and its Lua implementation are a good choice.

3: We haven't decided on the other tools we'll use for in-game element design yet, but in terms of 3D editors, we plan to use Blender. As a general-purpose and free 3D editor, it's easy for us to get started and try it out.

4: For AI, we divide it into two parts. In the code, we plan to use AI only for checking when multiple attempts fail. In the game's art elements, we'll likely use online or local AI models to generate images because we don't have much time to dedicate to art. We can only make minor modifications; the main images will be generated by AI.

## Outlook

The two biggest and most difficult aspects of this project are: first, we need to handle the initial code and framework integration and uploading ourselves. We haven't tried this in previous courses, so it's entirely new this time. Second, both the Love2D framework and the Lua language are completely new, meaning we need to relearn a new framework and Lua programming methods. These are the main challenges and difficulties. This way, we can learn a new language and a new framework, and if possible, we'll also learn some Blender usage.
